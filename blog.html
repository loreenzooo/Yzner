        <h2>BLACK TRAILBLAZERS IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY</h2>
        <p>As a Black creative, I can honestly say that the past few years have been interesting and encouraging. Since
          the pandemic’s beginning, when more people were on social media, there was much more emphasis on following
          Black creatives online, especially during Black History Month.</p>

          <p>Since the pandemic’s beginning, when more people were on social media, there was much more emphasis on
            following Black creatives online, especially during Black History Month. What I thought was a gimmick
            initially connected me to many people I consider ongoing friends today. My follower count on Instagram went
            up, and more people are engaging with many of my online history lessons.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO MAKE TIME FOR SIDE PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>Side projects are the lifeblood of creativity. Whether you want to become a better illustrator, venture into
          a new artistic field or simply remind yourself why you got into this game in the first place, a well-planned
          passion project has the power to boost your craft, build your reputation and even win you work.</p>
        <div class="more-content">
          <p>Take letterer Jessica Hische, whose side project Daily Drop Cap raised her profile and brought in a number
            of new clients, including Google and The New York Times. Or Tina Roth Eisenberg - aka Swiss Miss - who was
            so successful in her self-initiated ventures (breakfast lecture series Creative Mornings and design-led
            temporary tattoo business Tattly) that her client work has been on hold ever since.</p>

          <p>I'm a commercial illustrator based in Australia. I live in a rural town called Ballarat, 60 miles west of
            Melbourne. I'm nearly 40 and have a wife, three kids, and two dogs.

            Most of my work is vector-based. I've been a freelance illustrator for the last ten years after
